# OpenForecast
OpenForecast is a demonstration of how to access the information stored in an online URL in JSON format and how to present that data in WPF, XML, and C#. To use this software, you will need to have an openweathermap.org API key and a valid Gmail account, username, and password that you can use for email alert purposes. If not installed automatically, you will also need to install Newtonsoft.Json NET Framework and Restsharp through NuGet.
